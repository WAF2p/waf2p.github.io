- q: "What is WAF++ in one sentence?"
  a: |
    WAF++ is a community-driven framework to assess cloud and platform architectures in a structured way,
    make decisions traceable, and implement improvements along clear guardrails.

- q: "Is WAF++ vendor-neutral?"
  a: |
    Yes. WAF++ is built around principles, patterns, and standards — not around specific products or cloud providers.

- q: "Is WAF++ a fork of Well-Architected?"
  a: |
    No. WAF++ uses similar thinking (e.g., guardrails and trade-offs), but extends it with governance, working groups,
    RFC processes, maturity/scoring approaches, and reference models.

- q: "Who is WAF++ for?"
  a: |
    For platform teams, architects, security/compliance, SRE/operations, and auditors who want to make architecture quality
    measurable and repeatable — independent of provider and tooling.

- q: "What are the 7 pillars?"
  a: |
    The pillars bundle perspectives (e.g., cost, security, reliability, sovereign). Each pillar provides guiding questions,
    evidence/artifact hints, and typical trade-offs.

- q: "Which pillars are currently available?"
  a: |
    At the start, we prioritize Pillar 2 (Cost Optimization) and Pillar 7 (Sovereign). Additional pillars follow iteratively
    once content, examples, and scoring approaches have matured sufficiently.

- q: "What does 'Sovereign' mean in the WAF++ context?"
  a: |
    Sovereignty includes data control, controllability, traceability, exit capability,
    regulatory alignment, and vendor-risk reduction — both technically and organizationally.

- q: "Is there a maturity model or scoring?"
  a: |
    Yes — as a target vision. We work iteratively: first clear questions & evidence, then scoring/levels and reference models.
    The approach is meant to be transparent (no black-box assessments).

- q: "What does a typical start look like?"
  a: |
    Start small: pick a pillar (e.g., cost), answer the guiding questions with evidence (e.g., policies, dashboards, ADRs),
    derive 3–5 actions, and repeat the cycle regularly.

- q: "How do you ensure traceability and auditability?"
  a: |
    Through public discussions, reviews, and RFCs. Larger changes are documented as RFCs (problem, options,
    decision, impact) and versioned.

- q: "How can I contribute?"
  a: |
    Via issues/PRs, reviews, working groups, use cases from projects/audits, examples (patterns/anti-patterns),
    or by supporting sessions/BoFs at conferences.

- q: "Do I need to contribute code to be a contributor?"
  a: |
    No. Content, reviews, discussions, examples, translations, issue triage, and moderation are equally valuable.

- q: "How do you handle security topics?"
  a: |
    Responsible disclosure: security issues are reported privately and published in a coordinated way.
    Details are in the repository's security policy.

- q: "Which license does WAF++ use?"
  a: |
    WAF++ uses a dual-license model: Apache License 2.0 for code and CC BY 4.0 for documentation.
    The authoritative sources are LICENSE/NOTICE in the repository and the notes on /legal/.

- q: "Is there a roadmap?"
  a: |
    Yes. We prioritize transparently and actively look for contributors for content, reviews, working groups, and real-world examples.
